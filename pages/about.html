        <h1>About Me</h1><br>
        Hi, my name is Henry Chang.  Having lived in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia
        for most of my life, I have had the luck and pleasure of enjoying the mountainous backyard of the
        North Shore.  Hiking has always been a passion of mine.  I love going out to
        explore the great outdoors at every oppurtunity.  I started taking pictures of my hikes last year when I
        acquired a new phone (Samsung S9) and realized that I've been borne witness to so many stellar mountaintop views
        while hiking; yet have no record of it save for the inside of my forgetful head.  I created the website Canadian Hiker
        as a hobby, for the sole purpose of showcasing photographs I took with my S9 camera during my hiking adventures;
        combining my passion for hiking with my other interest of computer programming.
      <br><br>
        This website is still a current work in progress but I hope users can still enjoy it and hopefully become inspired to
        go on hiking adventures of their own.
      <br><br>
        For those interested, you can find more of my "work" via my instagram handle:
